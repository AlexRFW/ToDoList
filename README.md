This app allows you to add and remove items to a list. The user can add a title, a time and date, and some personal notes. When tapped, the screen displays this info. As a personal touch, the user is asked to remove the item from the list when he or she taps the checked button on the main screen. No need to clutter your to-do list with old items, keep it clean and organised!
